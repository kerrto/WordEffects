// The app will take in two pieces of data from the user:

// a number, to indicate which operation to do
//a string, to operate on
// Wrap the whole app in an infinite while loop, so users can do multiple operations.

//   Be sure to print out the menu of options at the start of each loop of the app.

// As you go through the steps of this assignment, be sure to commit regularly, and push your code to GitHub.

//255 unit long array of characters
//As you go through the assignment, use NSLog to print out the values, and memory addresses of the objects you create and modify. Methods on NSString result in new strings, rather than modifying strings in place. This is because NSString is immutable. You could use NSMutableString for some of these operations, but not all. In general NSMutableString tends to be used quite sparingly in Cocoa.

//Operations
//1. Uppercase
//Take whatever string the user inputs and MAKE IT LOUDER! Go have a look at the documentation or the header files for NSString, and look for methods that can help with this. Print the resulting string.

//2. Lowercase
//Take whatever text the user inputs and make it all lowercase. Print the resulting string.

//3. Numberize
//Take whatever text the user inputs, for example the string "10", and convert it to a number (e.g. the integer 10), if possible. Print the resulting number. Consider what inputs will give a valid number, and if you are able to tell if the conversion was successful or not. There is more than one way to do this conversion.

//4. Canadianize
//Take the user's input, and append ", eh?" to it. Print the resulting string.

//5. Respond
//If the user input ends with a question mark, answer "I don't know". If the input ends with an exclaimation point, respond with "Whoa, calm down!".

//6. De-Space-It
//Replace all spaces with "-". Print the resulting string.

//Stretch Goals
//Add a few more string manipulations. For example, word count, or punctuation removal.
//Convert everywhere you've used NSString to use NSMutableString if possible, and convert everywhere you've used NSMutableString to use NSString, if possible.
